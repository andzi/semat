State	1 - Recognized

Type	Wording change
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	All the different groups of stakeholders that are, or will be, affected by the development and operation of the software system are identified.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholders have been identified
Proposal	Possible stakeholders groups are identified
Rationale	The key behind this state is identifying possible stakeholder groups. All stakeholders groups might not be known at the start of a project. A team should be able to enumerate the stakeholder groups.

Type	Wording change
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	There is agreement on the stakeholder groups to be represented. At a minimum, the stakeholders groups that fund, use, support, and maintain the system have been considered.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	there is an agreement for stakeholder groups to be represented
Proposal	Team agrees on relevant stakeholder groups to be represented
Rationale	"Eliminates ""to be"" verb. Clarifies that the key is to select relevant stakeholders. This acknowledges the dynamic where not all stakeholder groups have equal voice in the project."

OMG 1.0	The stakeholder representatives have agreed to take on their responsibilities.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholder representatives agreed to take on responsibilities & authorized
Proposal	Stakeholder representatives agreed to take on responsibilities
Rationale	The Shord-Hand combined the second and fifth checklists from OMG. These are independent concepts and should be treated separately

OMG 1.0	The collaboration approach among the stakeholder representatives has been agreed.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	collaboration approach agreed
Proposal	Stakeholders agree on collaboration approach

Type	Moved to different alpha
Severity	Major
OMG 1.0	The stakeholder representatives support and respect the team's way of working.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	representatives respect team way of working
Proposal	Representatives respect team's principals
Rationale	"This checklist item describes the team's progression in Way of Working and should be in place in the Way of Working alpha, 1 - Principles Established state. The stakeholders respecting the team's Way of Working is an important component of the progression of Way of Working, its not part of the natural progression of the Stakeholder's alpha. Once it is in the context of the Way of Working alpha, using the phrase ""Way of Working"" is redundant. We rephrased it to be clear about the original intent"

Type	Revert back to OMG
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	The stakeholder representatives are authorized to carry out their responsibilities.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholder representatives agreed to take on responsibilities & authorized
Proposal	Stakeholder representatives empowered to take on responsibilities
Rationale	"The Shord-Hand combined the second and fifth checklists from OMG. These are independent concepts and should be treated separately. We replace ""authorized"" with ""empowered"" as its a stronger and clearer verb"

OMG 1.0	The team members agree that their input is valued by the stakeholder representatives and treated with respect.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	<deleted>
Proposal	Stakeholder representatives value team's input
Rationale	We reverse the wording in order to put into active tense. While this was dropped in the short-hand version, it’s important.  Respect should go both ways between the team and the stakeholder representatives. We observed one team where this was not the case.

Type	Drop OMG checklist item
Severity	Minor
OMG 1.0	The stakeholder representatives agree with how their different priorities and perspectives are being balanced to provide a clear direction for the team.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	<deleted>

State	5 -  Satisfied for Deployment

Type	Drop OMG and short-hand checklist item
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	The stakeholder representatives provide feedback on the system from their stakeholder group perspective.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholder representatives provide feedback on system from their stakeholder perspective
Proposal	<deleted>
Rationale	"The two checklist items are almost identical. The phrase ""feedback on the system"" can imply that the system is already deployed. We want the client to authorize the deployment of the system. We observed people confused by this checklist item."

Type	Wording change
Severity	Minor
OMG 1.0	The stakeholders confirm that the new system meets their expectations.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholder need and expectations are being met
Proposal	Stakeholders confirm that system meets their expectations.
Rationale	We put this in the active tense.

Type	New alpha state

OMG 1.0	Stakeholders are using the new system and providing feedback on their experiences.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	<deleted>
Proposal	"Add a new Alpha State, ""5.A - Providing Feedback"" with the checklist item ""Stakeholders provide feedback on their experiences"""
Rationale	"There is a difference between acknolweding that a system is ready to be deployed, deploying it and collecting user feedback, and having the stakeholders be satisfied with its use. Its common for the initial deployment to surface issues that need to be addressed. This is a ""hidden"" state between Satisfied for Deployment and Satisfied in Use. In short, stakeholders are using the system and providing feedback."

Alpha	Opportunity
State	1 - Identified

Type	Wording change
Severity	Minor
OMG 1.0	An idea for a way of improving current ways of working, increasing market share or applying a new or innovative software system has been identified.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	opportunity identified that could be addressed by a software-based solution
Proposal	Software-based solution addresses an identified opportunity
Rationale	We put this in the active tense.

Short-hand Cards 1.0	a stakeholder wishes to make an investment in better understanding potential value
Proposal	Stakeholders wishes to make an investment in better understanding potential value

Type	Drop OMG and short-hand checklist item

Short-hand Cards 1.0	other stakeholders who share opportunity identified
Proposal	<deleted>
Rationale	This is unnecessary as it is covered by the Stakeholder alpha, where it belongs.
State	2 - Solution Needed

Type	Reorder checklist items, significant rewording to clarify intent
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	Any underlying problems and their root causes have been identified.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	underlying problem and root causes identified
Proposal	1. Problem is clearly articulated
Rationale	The word, “underlying” implies that you found the opportunity first, then you discover the problem underneath it. While this often can happen on software projects, this is not always the case. Projects might clearly understand the problem then derive appropriate solutions.  Furthermore, the original wording implies a project management technique of root cause analysis. The core desired outcome is that the problem is clearly identified. Without properly identifying the problem, we fall into the anti-pattern of building a solution in need of a problem.

Type	Reorder checklist items, significant rewording to clarify intent
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	The stakeholders' needs that generate the opportunity have been established.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	stakeholder needs identified
Proposal	2. Opportunity addresses problem and stakeholder needs.

Type	Reorder checklist items, significant rewording to clarify intent
Severity	Medium
OMG 1.0	It has been confirmed that a software-based solution is needed.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	need for software-based solution confirmed
Proposal	3. Software can solve the problem.
Rationale	Note. There appears to be a logical progression through three of the checklist items. This is troublesome since the checklist items typically are independent and could be accomplished in parallel. We've numbered them for clarity on the sequencing.

Type	Drop OMG and short-hand checklist item

OMG 1.0	The indications are that the solution can be developed and deployed within constraints.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	indications are solutions can be developed & deployed within constraints
Proposal	Solution is deployable within constraints
Rationale	"We tightened this phrase by removing the unnecessary words. ""Indications are"" paints the analysis as very informal. ***"

Type	Wording change
Severity	Minor
OMG 1.0	The risks associated with the solution are acceptable and manageable.
Short-hand Cards 1.0	risks are manageable
Proposal	Risks associated with solution are acceptable and manageable.
Rationale	In this context, these are not project risks, but risks associated with the solution meeting the needs of the opportunity. The original OMG version is clearer about this.

Type	Drop OMG checklist item
